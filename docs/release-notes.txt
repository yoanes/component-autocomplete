==== Version 1.1.6-001 (tag: autocomplete_v1_1_6-001) ====

Fixed:
- CUI-223: AutoComplete - Upgrade to core-component 1.0.28 (requires device-config.xml implementation)
- CUI-183: Autosuggest testpage -> Autosuggestion list is not displayed correctly for yellow /white keywords with special characters e.g. '&'
    - JavaScript default adapters now ensure that query strings are URI encoded.

Update notes
- Now depends on wl-core-component 1.0.29.
- bind tag now requires device attribute to be set. 

==== Version 1.1.6 (tag: autocomplete_v1_1_6) ====

- Fixed up the environment properties for dev / tst / stg & prd.
