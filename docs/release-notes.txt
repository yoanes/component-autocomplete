==== Version 1.1.6-003 (tag: autocomplete_v1_1_6-003) ====

Upgrade notes:
- Now depends on:

    <dependency org="com.sensis" name="wl-core-component" rev="1.0.31" conf="default,test"/>

==== Version 1.1.6-002 (tag: autocomplete_v1_1_6-002) ====

Fixed:
- CUI-189: Autocomplete testpage -> Autosuggest list  takes long time to appear , even when user has finished typing the keyword
    - added potential optimisation for YM. The component provides a proxy that will limit the number of results
      returned to the client (since the Yellow datasource does not provide this functionality).
    
Upgrade notse:
- Now depends on:

        <dependency org="org.codehaus" name="jackson-core-asl" rev="1.2.1" conf="default"/>
        <dependency org="org.codehaus" name="jackson-mapper-asl" rev="1.2.1" conf="default"/>
        
- The autocomplete:bind tag now has a mandatory proxy attribute. Sample values for each standard datasource:

    YM: proxy="_AUTOCOMPLETE_YM_.proxy"
    WPM: proxy="_AUTOCOMPLETE_WPM_.proxy"
    Location: proxy="_AUTOCOMPLETE_LOCATION_.proxy"
    
- Your webapp's environment properties needs to define env.autocomplete.proxy.ym.url in addition to the
  env.autocomplete.proxy.url that you previously specified. Sample values for a desktop environment:
  
    env.autocomplete.proxy.url=http://localhost:8080/wl-autocomplete-component-showcase/comp/autocomplete/urlproxy
    env.autocomplete.proxy.ym.url=http://localhost:8080/wl-autocomplete-component-showcase/comp/autocomplete/yellowurlproxy
      
  ie. /comp/autocomplete/urlproxy and /comp/autocomplete/yellowurlproxy are relative to the webapp's context root.
